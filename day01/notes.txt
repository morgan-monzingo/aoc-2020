Morgan's Notes for solving (not tried so feel free to do something else) 
Sort list 
Counter for front 
Counter for back
Iterate through the front of the list
add front number to the back number  of the list until you find the sum of something lower than what you want.  
if lower than what you want
Move front counter forward
Move back counter back 1 (so you don’t hit numbers you know are too big) 
if sum what you want
save both numbers
print multiplied value out 
if sum bigger than you want
move back counter closer to front
